**Facts of the Case:**
- The appellants were detained under the Sind Control of Gonads Act for failing to provide security.

**Decision of the Federal Court:**

- The court concluded that the amendment altering the date in Section 9(5) of the Indian Independence Act was not valid.
  
**Question Involved in the Case:**
- The main issue was whether the amendment Act altering the date in Section 9(5) was valid when Section 92-A was added to the Government of India Act in July 1948.

**Observation of Federal Court:**
- The Federal Court emphasized that a legislature cannot validate an invalid law if it lacks the power to legislate on the issue.
- It stated that only the constituent assembly could amend the relevant acts, and the Governor General did not possess that authority.
- The Court suggested that a new representative body should have been formed to validate any invalid legislation after the constituent assembly ceased to exist.

**In simpler terms:**

- They went to court saying their detention was wrong.
- The Chief Court said the detention was okay.
- They appealed to the Federal Court.
- The Federal Court said a change in the law wasn't done properly.
- They discussed who has the power to change laws.
- The Court said only a specific group can change laws, and the Governor General didn't have that power.
- They suggested forming a new group to fix any wrong laws.
