# Provisional Election Results Data for Pakistan's 2018 General Elections

This repository hosts results data as reported by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for general elections for the national and provincial assemblies, held on July 25 2018. The output, collecting all candidate result reports, is released in a tidy .csv format in the file **[pk_candidate_data_2018.csv](https://github.com/colincookman/pakistan_election_results_2018/blob/master/pk_candidate_data_2018.csv)**. This data has also been re-aggregated into a constituency-level summary in the file **[pk_constituency_data_2018.csv](https://github.com/colincookman/pakistan_election_results_2018/blob/master/pk_constituency_data_2018.csv)**.

This data is **provisional** and current only as of approximately 12:00 PM GMT September 04 2018. The results collected may be altered by recounts, legal complaints, and other disputes and adjudication. 

ECP data entry errors are also likely to be identified; [vote_total_discrepancies.csv](https://github.com/colincookman/pakistan_election_results_2018/blob/master/vote_total_discrepancies.csv) identifies cases where the ECP's reported total valid votes cast does not match the sum of available candidate data. At least initially, "test data" appears to have been entered into the system as announced results rather than corrected to reflect actual election-day results, and as of initial observation the ECP had not corrected this in a currently undetermined number of cases.

These datasets are being revised and updated as corrected information is available, and some summary analysis figures will shift as a result. This repository remain a work in progress and caution is advised when using it for analysis. The author cannot verify the accuracy of, or account for any discrepancies in, the underlying data. For questions, suggestions, or to contribute, please leave an issue here or contact Colin Cookman by email or Twitter.

# Data sources
Although currently not linked directly from the front page of its website, the ECP has released machine-readable results data [through its website](https://www.ecp.gov.pk/ResultDetails.aspx?EleId=10070&Election=General%20Election%2025%20Jul%202018). (Data was also released through a [results dashboard](https://www.ecp.gov.pk/resultdashboard/ge2018.aspx), now deactivated; see [Wayback capture](https://web.archive.org/web/20180728030351/https://www.ecp.gov.pk/resultdashboard/ge2018.aspx) as of July 27 for reference). Constituency-level results were downloaded and consolidated from the ECP website to create this dataset. 

The ECP has also released scanned copies of Form 45 (Polling Station Result of the Count), Form 46 (Ballot Paper Account), Form 47 (Provisional Constituency Results), Form 48 (Consolidated Statement of the Result of the Count), and Form 49 (Final Consolidated Result) forms in [Google Drive folders linked through its website](https://www.ecp.gov.pk//frmGenericPage.aspx?PageID=3170). Although not currently digitized, these may potentially serve as a cross-check on some results.

A mirrored copy of the scanned forms can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mO-Wz6PvEA0QojpQm_4J9FNg0pkBKmEl). Due to the size of the files, many folders were automatically split by the Google download function into multiple separate zip files, which will need to be merged (option-drag on a Mac) to ensure a single consolidated set of folders.

# Caveats and gaps in the data
An apparent breakdown in the ECP results management system (RMS) delayed the reporting and consolidation of results, and the full provisional results for all constituencies where elections were held were not reported until July 28 2018. Some candidates and political parties [made complaints](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1766621/1-key-national-parties-insist-massive-rigging/) that their agent observers were denied access to the final count at polling stations, and have challenged the accuracy of the final figures, but the ECP [denied](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1766411/1-ecp-rejects-political-parties-claim-rigging-election-day/) those charges. 

Elections were postponed in the following constituencies either due to the death or recent disqualification of a contesting candidate: NA-60, NA-103, PK-78, PK-99, PP-87, PP-103, PS-87, and PB-35. PS-6 was uncontested.

Note that constituency boundaries were changed in early 2018 following the 2017 census, changing the electoral composition of many constituencies.

Further expansion and analysis of the elections will continue as more information becomes available.
